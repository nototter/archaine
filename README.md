# NOTICE
i was renamed from alpine to archaine because of overlapping

only use for educational purposes or networks you are allowed to "hack" in

everything is a work in progress right now

## info
a more user friendly (but slightly worse) version of metasploit made in python3

optional modules:

HTTPX (for replicate site function)

flask (for reverse shell download)

## features
WIP fyi

reverse shells
nmap type network scanning

## plugins
follow example.py in the modules folder to make your own plugin

not the best plugin system fyi

# reporting errors
the issue must be with alpine, not a plugin

refer to a plugin's github/developer for issues
1. include what you did
2. show the error (TimeoutError, ConnectionRefusedError, KeyError)
3. what line is it on

to simplify this, just copy and paste the python error and submit it as an issue
