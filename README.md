# NOTICE
i was renamed from alpine to archaine because of overlapping

only use for educational purposes or networks you are allowed to "hack" in

this is dev branch half of the features will not work

# reporting errors
the issue must be with alpine, not a plugin

refer to a plugin's github/developer for issues
1. include what you did
2. show the error (TimeoutError, ConnectionRefusedError, KeyError)
3. what line is it on

to simplify this, just copy and paste the python error and submit it as an issue
