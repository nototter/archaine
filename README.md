# NOTICE
everything is a work in progress right now

# alpine
a more user friendly (but slightly worse) version of metasploit made in python3

base modules needed:

HTTPX (optional, for replicate site function)

# plugins
wip

# reporting errors
the issue must be with alpine, not a plugin
refer to a plugin's github/developer for issues
1. include what you did
2. show the error (TimeoutError, ConnectionRefusedError, KeyError)
3. what line is it on

to simplify this, just copy and paste the python error and submit it as an issue
